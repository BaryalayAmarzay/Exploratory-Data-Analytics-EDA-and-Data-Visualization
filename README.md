Data Analysis and Visualization Project
Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a dataset, including data exploration, cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. The work is structured into two main components: a notebook and a report. These files collectively document the process of handling data, performing statistical calculations, and visualizing insights.
________________________________________
Files Included
1. Notebook (notebook_name.ipynb)
The notebook contains the step-by-step code and detailed explanations of the following processes:
•	Data Import: Loading the dataset into the notebook.
•	Data Exploration: Understanding the structure, types, and basic statistics of the dataset.
•	Handling Missing Values: Identifying and addressing missing or inconsistent data.
•	Data Cleaning: Preparing the dataset for analysis by removing or transforming irrelevant data.
•	Statistical Analysis: Performing descriptive and inferential statistical operations.
•	Data Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to represent insights visually.
This notebook serves as a practical walkthrough of the data analysis process.

2. Report (report_name.pdf)
The report provides a concise summary of the key findings and insights derived from the data analysis. It includes:
•	A brief overview of the dataset and its purpose.
•	Key observations and trends identified during data exploration.
•	A summary of statistical measures and their implications.
•	Visualization highlights, showcasing the most important results through graphs and charts.
•	Conclusion and recommendations based on the analysis.
The report is designed for stakeholders who prefer an executive summary of the project.
